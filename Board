/**
 * The purpose of Board is to create an internal array that all movemeents can be managed on and every class can access and use 
 Board allows us to test moves and can be refreshed with the display Board any time it becoems corrupted or we want to refresh it to run other 
 tests 
 Board also has native methods that piece and other classes can use and we are working on adding a moveRecorder here so that we can have one 
 moveRecorder class instead of one for every piece which creates complication
