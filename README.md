# Chess
Main src is in final, We tried to update master but not all the needed images are in master 
No bugs with Player vs. Player except for undo move not working up to a certain point(think its thread overloading but we didn't have time 
to test) 
Final has a list of bugs with A.I. v.s Player
When you open it there is a screen where you can scroll through directions slides 
Can choose who's A.I. and player from a menu, but can't have two A.I's 
All PvP functions work, including castling, check, checkmate, enpassant, promotion etc. 
We were unable to implement castling, enpassant and promotion into the A.I as we ran out of time before the project was due, however the player can still perform these actions and it will not affect the A.I.

  The A.I. plays an opening read from a file
