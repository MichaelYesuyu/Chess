Opening repretoire sourced from nikslaf/eco

Current bugs:

Reset board might not actually reset the board, just goes back to title screen

Engine sometimes stop working after some moves

Undo move does not work for the first few moves when playing against the engine (opening repretoire)

Engine does not choose to castle or promote
